# 🔒 Security & Best Practices

## 🛡️ Environment Security

### **✅ What's Already Secured:**
- **`.env` added to `.gitignore`** - Your keys won't be committed to git
- **Frontend-only setup** - Key secrets not exposed in browser
- **HTTPS required** - Razorpay requires secure connections

### **🚨 Critical Security Rules:**

#### **DO:**
- ✅ Keep `.env` file private and secure
- ✅ Use test keys for development/testing
- ✅ Switch to live keys only for production
- ✅ Monitor Razorpay dashboard regularly
- ✅ Use HTTPS for your website (required by Razorpay)

#### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Never commit `.env` file to version control
- ❌ Never share live keys publicly
- ❌ Never put keys directly in source code
- ❌ Never use live keys for testing

## 🔑 Key Management

### **Key Types Explained:**

#### **Key ID (`rzp_test_*` / `rzp_live_*`)**
- **Usage**: Frontend/public use
- **Security**: Safe to expose in browser
- **Purpose**: Identifies your Razorpay account

#### **Key Secret (`secret_key`)**
- **Usage**: Server-side only (not used in our setup)
- **Security**: Must never be exposed publicly
- **Purpose**: Server-side payment verification

### **Our Setup Security:**
- ✅ **Only Key ID used**: Safe for frontend
- ✅ **No Key Secret in frontend**: Maximum security
- ✅ **Razorpay handles verification**: No server needed

## 🌐 Website Security

### **HTTPS Requirement:**
- **Development**: http://localhost is fine
- **Production**: Must use https://
- **Razorpay**: Requires HTTPS for live payments

### **Domain Verification:**

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerts

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### **If Keys are Compromised:**
1. **Immediately disable** keys in Razorpay dashboard
2. **Generate new keys**
3. **Update `.env` file** with new keys
4. **Monitor for unauthorized transactions**
5. **Contact Razorpay support** if needed

### **Incident Response:**

```

### **Version Control:**

echo ".env" >> .gitignore
