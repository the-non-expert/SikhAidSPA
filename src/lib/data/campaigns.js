			With the support of 300+ volunteers and local kitchens, meals are distributed across 20+ cities and 2,000+ villages in states like Odisha, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Punjab, and Delhi. In 2023-24 alone, over 100,000 meals were served, continuing the spirit of seva at just ‚Çπ60 per meal.

			This initiative embodies the Sikh principle of 'Langar' - community kitchens that serve free meals to all, regardless of background, caste, or creed. Every meal served is a step towards eliminating hunger and fostering unity in our diverse nation.

		When devastating floods hit Punjab in January 2025, Sikh Aid Charitable Trust mobilized within hours to provide emergency relief to affected families. Our rapid response network enabled us to reach the most vulnerable communities first, focusing on rural farming communities who were cut off from main roads due to flooding.

		Our teams worked around the clock in coordination with local authorities to ensure efficient relief distribution. The dedication of our volunteers provided not only essential supplies but also hope and emotional support during the darkest hours for flood victims.

		As of today, we continue to provide support to 1,500 families still in temporary accommodations. Our focus has shifted to rehabilitation and helping families rebuild their lives and livelihoods, demonstrating our long-term commitment to disaster recovery.
